Windows line breaks use two characters, '\n\r' whilst Linux line breaks just use '\n'. This is due to a historical discrepancy. In the days of manual typewriters, the process of starting on a new line involved two separate actions: line break and carriage return. When TeleType was invented, it was decided to cut this down to a single command character in order to save on message length, as it was charged per-character. Linux inherits many of its features from TeleType via UNIX, indeed this is why login terminals are known as ttyX.
